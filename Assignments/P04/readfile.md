To read a file into a slice in Go, where each line of the file becomes an entry in the slice, you can use the `bufio` package to read the file line by line. Here's an example in Go that demonstrates this:

```go
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func readFileLines(filePath string) ([]string, error) {
    file, err := os.Open(filePath)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    defer file.Close()

    var lines []string
    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
    for scanner.Scan() {
        lines = append(lines, scanner.Text())
    }
    
    return lines, scanner.Err()
}

func main() {
    filePath := "path/to/your/file.txt" // Replace with your file path
    lines, err := readFileLines(filePath)
    if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("Error reading file:", err)
        return
    }

    for i, line := range lines {
        fmt.Printf("Line %d: %s\n", i+1, line)
    }
}
```

In this code:
- `readFileLines` is a function that opens the specified file for reading.
- It creates a `bufio.Scanner` that reads the file line by line.
- Each line read by the scanner is appended to a slice of strings.
- Once all lines are read, the function returns the slice.
- The `main` function calls `readFileLines` with the path of the file to be read and prints each line.

This is a standard way to read a file into a slice in Go, with each line of the file becoming an element in the slice. The `bufio` package provides efficient, buffered reading of the file, which is particularly useful for large files.
