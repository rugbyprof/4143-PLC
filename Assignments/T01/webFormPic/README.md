Certainly, I can provide you with an example that uses the Gin framework to create routes for both displaying the form and handling image downloads. First, make sure you have Gin installed by running `go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin` if it's not already installed. Then, you can create the following Go program:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    // Create a Gin router
    r := gin.Default()

    // Serve static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript) from a directory named "static"
    r.Static("/static", "./static")

    // Define a route to display the form
    r.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.HTML(http.StatusOK, "index.html", nil)
    })

    // Define a route to handle image downloads
    r.POST("/download", func(c *gin.Context) {
        // Get the URL entered by the user
        imageURL := c.PostForm("imageURL")

        // You can add your image downloading logic here
        // For simplicity, we'll just return the entered URL for now
        c.String(http.StatusOK, "Image URL entered: %s", imageURL)
    })

    // Run the web server on port 8080
    r.Run(":8080")
}
```

In this example:

1. We create a Gin router using `gin.Default()`.

2. We use `r.Static` to serve static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript) from a directory named "static."

3. We define a route with `r.GET("/")` to display the HTML form. The form is rendered from an HTML file named "index.html," which should be located in the same directory as your Go program.

4. We define a route with `r.POST("/download")` to handle image downloads. It retrieves the image URL entered by the user and can be extended with your image downloading logic.

5. The web server is started using `r.Run(":8080")`, and it listens on port 8080.

Now, you need to create an "index.html" file in the same directory as your Go program with the HTML form. Here's a simple example of the "index.html" file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Image Downloader</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Image Downloader</h1>
    <form action="/download" method="post">
        <label for="imageURL">Enter Image URL:</label><br>
        <input type="text" id="imageURL" name="imageURL" required><br><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Download">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

With this setup, when you run your Go program and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser, you'll see the form. After entering an image URL and clicking "Download," the entered URL will be displayed on the page. You can replace the simple display logic with your image downloading code as needed.
