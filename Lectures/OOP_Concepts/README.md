# OOP Concepts - Intro to OOP in Go
#### None

1. **[Not OOP](01-not_oop.md)**: Start with a brief introduction to Go's approach to object-oriented programming (OOP) or rather, its preference for composition over inheritance. Explain why Go doesn't have traditional classes and inheritance.

2. **[New Keyword](02-new_keyword.md)**: Explain the use of the `new` keyword in Go for dynamic memory allocation.

3. **[Slices of Structs](03-slices_of_structs.md)**: Discuss the use of slices of structs for managing collections of structured data.

4. **[Maps](04-maps.md)**: Introduce maps as a way to create key-value associations in Go.

5. **[Struct vs. Interface](05-struct_vs_interface.md)**: Introduce structs as the basic building blocks for data and explain interfaces as a way to define behavior. This sets the stage for understanding Go's type system.

6. **[Methods vs. Functions](06-methods_vs_functions.md)**: Explore the distinction between methods and functions in Go and how methods are associated with types (structs).

7. **[First-Class Functions](07-first_class_func.md)**: Discuss the concept of first-class functions in Go and how functions can be treated as values, covering anonymous functions and user-defined function types.

8. **[Inheritance](08-inheritance.md)**: How does Go implement inheritance?

9. **[Interfaces and Inheritance](09-interfaces_and_inheritance.md)**: Finally, discuss how Go achieves polymorphism through interfaces and compare it to traditional inheritance.

10. **[Interfaces](10-interfaces.md)**: Go deeper into interfaces, covering interface declaration, implementation, and polymorphism.
   
11. **[Composition Over Inheritance](11-comp_over_inherit.md)**: Reinforce the idea of composition over inheritance, showing how to embed structs within other structs and use composition to build complex types.
