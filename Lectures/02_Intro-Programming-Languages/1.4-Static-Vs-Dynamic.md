# Static Vs Dynamic

- Static typing enforces type `checking at compile time`, requiring `explicit` type declarations and catching type errors before execution. 
- Dynamic typing performs type `checking at runtime`, allowing `implicit` type changes but potentially leading to runtime errors. 
- Static typing emphasizes early error detection and type safety, 
- Dynamic typing prioritizes development flexibility and speed.

## Static Typing

1. **Type Checking at Compile Time:**
   - In statically typed languages, type checking occurs during the compilation phase of the program. 
   - This means that the compiler analyzes the code and ensures that all variables and expressions conform to their declared types before the program is even executed.

2. **Explicit Type Declarations:**
   - Statically typed languages require developers to explicitly declare the data type of variables. 
   - For example, if you want to create an integer variable, you must declare it as `int x` or provide the type information explicitly.
   - Small exceptions include languages like go in which implicit typing is still checked at compile time.

3. **Compile-Time Errors:**
   - Static typing helps in early error detection. 
   - If there's a type mismatch or violation of type rules, the compiler raises errors during the compilation process. 
   - These errors must be addressed and resolved before the program can be executed.

4. **Type Safety:**
   - Static typing offers a high degree of type safety because potential type-related issues are caught at compile time. 
   - This minimizes the risk of runtime errors caused by type mismatches.
   - Go and Ada are good examples that use type safety.

5. **Examples of Statically Typed Languages:**
   - Statically typed languages include C, C++, Java, C#, Rust, and Go. 
   - These languages prioritize early error detection and strong(ish) type safety.
   - What does it mean strong(ish)? And this doesn't apply to each language listed.

## Dynamically Typing

1. **Type Checking at Runtime:**
   - In dynamically typed languages, type checking is deferred until runtime, during the actual execution of the program. 
   - The interpreter or runtime environment verifies data types as the code is executed.

2. **Implicit Type Conversion:**
   - Dynamically typed languages allow variables to change their data type implicitly during the program's execution. 
   - For example, a variable that initially holds an integer can later store a string without explicit type casting.

3. **Run-Time Errors:**
   - Type-related errors in dynamically typed languages are detected during program execution, which may lead to exceptions or runtime errors. 
   - These issues are not caught until the relevant code is executed.

4. **Flexibility:**
   - Dynamically typed languages offer greater flexibility and ease of development. 
   - Developers do not need to explicitly specify data types, making code writing and prototyping quicker and more straightforward (but prone to errors as well).

5. **Examples of Dynamically Typed Languages:**
   - Dynamically typed languages include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, and Perl. 
   - These languages prioritize developer flexibility and rapid development, even if it means accepting some runtime risks. 

  
## Key Differences:

- **Type Checking:** 
  - Static typing performs type checking before execution (`compile time`), 
  - while dynamic typing performs it during execution (`runtime`).
- **Explicitness:** 
  - Static typing mandates `explicit type declarations`, 
  - whereas dynamic typing allows variables to `change types implicitly`.
- **Error Detection:** 
  - Static typing `catches type-related errors early`, during compilation, 
  - while dynamic typing `may result in runtime errors`.
- **Flexibility:** 
  - Dynamic typing offers more flexibility and eases development, 
  - but it may require thorough testing to catch type-related issues.


## Strong vs Weak

So there are a couple of nuances that need mentioned: Strong vs Weak typed languages. It seems that strongly typed languages would be compiled, and weakly typed languages would be interpreted (static vs dynamic), but thats not the case. Look at the diagram below. Python is strongly typed? C++ is weakly typed? So what does strong vs weak actually mean?

The distinction between strong and weak typing is often a source of confusion because there isn't a universally accepted definition for these terms. However, in general, a "strongly typed" language is one in which types are enforced, meaning that you can't, for example, add a string to an integer without explicitly converting one of them. A "weakly typed" language, in contrast, is more permissive with how you can mix and match types.


Even though c++ is compiled and statically typed it is also considered weakly typed. Here are a couple of examples:
  - It allows implicit type conversions (e.g. float to int and vice versa)
  - It also allows arithmetic operations between two different data types

Example:
```c++
float a = 123.456;
int b;
b = a;   // b now is simply 123 
b = '0'; // now b is 48 (ascii value of character zero)
       

int c = 0;
char d = '0';

cout<<(c+d)<<"\n"; // prints out 48
```

Python is considered strongly typed because it enforces type constraints. In Python, you can't just add a string to an integer or an integer to a list without explicitly converting types. For example, the following will raise a TypeError in Python:

```python
a = "123"
b = 456
print(a + b)  # Raises TypeError
```

However, Python is also dynamically typed, meaning that the type of a variable is determined at runtime and can change as the program executes. You don't need to declare the type of a variable when you write Python code. For instance:

```python
a = 123     # `a` is an integer
a = "abc"   # Now `a` is a string
```

This is in contrast to statically typed languages, where the type of each variable is explicitly declared and does not change, and type checks are performed at compile time.

So, in summary, Python is in the strong/dynamic quadrant because it enforces type constraints (strong typing) but determines types at runtime (dynamic typing). This combination allows for both robust type enforcement and flexible, dynamic code writing.

**Static Typing:**

- **Predictability:** Static typing can make code more predictable; since each variable's type is known at compile-time, the operations permitted on that type are also known, reducing the likelihood of unexpected behaviors at runtime.
- **Optimization:** Compilers for statically typed languages can more aggressively optimize code because they have more information about the types, which can lead to better performance and quicker execution times.
- **Type-Related Bugs:** A statically typed language can prevent a whole class of errors related to types, as these are usually caught during compilation rather than at runtime.
- **Refactoring Confidence:** When refactoring code, static typing can provide a level of assurance that changes have not introduced type mismatches, which can be particularly helpful in large codebases or when working with complex data structures.
- **Generics and Overloading:** Statically typed languages often support advanced type-related concepts like generics or function overloading, which rely on compile-time type information to work correctly.

**Dynamic Typing:**

- **Prototyping:** The ease of prototyping in dynamically typed languages comes from not having to commit to specific data types upfront, which can be particularly beneficial during the exploratory phase of development.
- **Meta-programming:** Dynamic typing facilitates meta-programming techniques, where code can be altered, generated, or evaluated at runtime. This can enable powerful patterns like dynamic inheritance, mixins, or domain-specific languages.
- **Readability vs. Explicitness:** While static types can serve as a form of documentation, dynamic typing often leads to more concise code, which can be easier to read but may require additional context or comments to clarify the expected types.
- **Third-party Libraries:** Using third-party libraries or APIs in a dynamic context can sometimes introduce surprises if the library changes its type expectations, whereas static typing can enforce contracts that must be adhered to.
- **Type Casting and Coercion:** Dynamically typed languages often perform type coercion automatically, which can be both a feature and a pitfall—useful when it works as expected but potentially leading to subtle bugs when it doesn't.
