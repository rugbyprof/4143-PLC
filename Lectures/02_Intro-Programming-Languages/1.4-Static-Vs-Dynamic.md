# Static Vs Dynamic

- Static typing enforces type `checking at compile time`, requiring `explicit` type declarations and catching type errors before execution. 
- Dynamic typing performs type `checking at runtime`, allowing `implicit` type changes but potentially leading to runtime errors. 
- Static typing emphasizes early error detection and type safety, 
- Dynamic typing prioritizes development flexibility and speed.

## Static Typing

1. **Type Checking at Compile Time:**
   - In statically typed languages, type checking occurs during the compilation phase of the program. 
   - This means that the compiler analyzes the code and ensures that all variables and expressions conform to their declared types before the program is even executed.

2. **Explicit Type Declarations:**
   - Statically typed languages require developers to explicitly declare the data type of variables. 
   - For example, if you want to create an integer variable, you must declare it as `int x` or provide the type information explicitly.
   - Small exceptions include languages like go in which implicit typing is still checked at compile time.

3. **Compile-Time Errors:**
   - Static typing helps in early error detection. 
   - If there's a type mismatch or violation of type rules, the compiler raises errors during the compilation process. 
   - These errors must be addressed and resolved before the program can be executed.

4. **Type Safety:**
   - Static typing offers a high degree of type safety because potential type-related issues are caught at compile time. 
   - This minimizes the risk of runtime errors caused by type mismatches.
   - Go and Ada are good examples that use type safety.

5. **Examples of Statically Typed Languages:**
   - Statically typed languages include C, C++, Java, C#, Rust, and Go. 
   - These languages prioritize early error detection and strong(ish) type safety.
   - What does it mean strong(ish)? And this doesn't apply to each language listed.

## Dynamically Typing

1. **Type Checking at Runtime:**
   - In dynamically typed languages, type checking is deferred until runtime, during the actual execution of the program. 
   - The interpreter or runtime environment verifies data types as the code is executed.

2. **Implicit Type Conversion:**
   - Dynamically typed languages allow variables to change their data type implicitly during the program's execution. 
   - For example, a variable that initially holds an integer can later store a string without explicit type casting.

3. **Run-Time Errors:**
   - Type-related errors in dynamically typed languages are detected during program execution, which may lead to exceptions or runtime errors. 
   - These issues are not caught until the relevant code is executed.

4. **Flexibility:**
   - Dynamically typed languages offer greater flexibility and ease of development. 
   - Developers do not need to explicitly specify data types, making code writing and prototyping quicker and more straightforward (but prone to errors as well).

5. **Examples of Dynamically Typed Languages:**
   - Dynamically typed languages include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, and Perl. 
   - These languages prioritize developer flexibility and rapid development, even if it means accepting some runtime risks. 

  
## Key Differences:

- **Type Checking:** 
  - Static typing performs type checking before execution (`compile time`), 
  - while dynamic typing performs it during execution (`runtime`).
- **Explicitness:** 
  - Static typing mandates `explicit type declarations`, 
  - whereas dynamic typing allows variables to `change types implicitly`.
- **Error Detection:** 
  - Static typing `catches type-related errors early`, during compilation, 
  - while dynamic typing `may result in runtime errors`.
- **Flexibility:** 
  - Dynamic typing offers more flexibility and eases development, 
  - but it may require thorough testing to catch type-related issues.


## Strong vs Weak

So there are a couple of nuances that need mentioned: Strong vs Weak typed languages. It seems that strongly typed languages would be compiled, and weakly typed languages would be interpreted (static vs dynamic), but thats not the case. Look at the diagram below. Python is strongly typed? C++ is weakly typed? So what does strong vs weak actually mean?

The distinction between strong and weak typing is often a source of confusion because there isn't a universally accepted definition for these terms. However, in general, a "strongly typed" language is one in which types are enforced, meaning that you can't, for example, add a string to an integer without explicitly converting one of them. A "weakly typed" language, in contrast, is more permissive with how you can mix and match types.


Even though c++ is compiled and statically typed it is also considered weakly typed. Here are a couple of examples:
  - It allows implicit type conversions (e.g. float to int and vice versa)
  - It also allows arithmetic operations between two different data types

Example:
```c++
float a = 123.456;
int b;
b = a;   // b now is simply 123 
b = '0'; // now b is 48 (ascii value of character zero)
       

int c = 0;
char d = '0';

cout<<(c+d)<<"\n"; // prints out 48
```

Python is considered strongly typed because it enforces type constraints. In Python, you can't just add a string to an integer or an integer to a list without explicitly converting types. For example, the following will raise a TypeError in Python:

```python
a = "123"
b = 456
print(a + b)  # Raises TypeError
```

However, Python is also dynamically typed, meaning that the type of a variable is determined at runtime and can change as the program executes. You don't need to declare the type of a variable when you write Python code. For instance:

```python
a = 123     # `a` is an integer
a = "abc"   # Now `a` is a string
```

This is in contrast to statically typed languages, where the type of each variable is explicitly declared and does not change, and type checks are performed at compile time.

So, in summary, Python is in the strong/dynamic quadrant because it enforces type constraints (strong typing) but determines types at runtime (dynamic typing). This combination allows for both robust type enforcement and flexible, dynamic code writing.



#### So now I kinda know what they are...
### Which one do I choose?
  Statically typed languages enforce type checking at compile time, requiring explicit type declarations for variables. This leads to early error detection and high type safety but potentially slower development due to the need for strict adherence to type rules. Dynamically typed languages, on the other hand, perform type checking at runtime, allowing variables to change types implicitly, offering greater flexibility and a faster development cycle. However, this flexibility comes at the cost of potentially introducing runtime errors. The choice between static and dynamic typing depends on the project's requirements, with statically typed languages emphasizing robustness and safety, and dynamically typed languages prioritizing developer ease and flexibility. There are languages that employ both dynamic and static ideals in the languages. Though whether they are classified "static" or "dynamic" is usually defined by how they natively enforce type checking. 
  
  The choice between static and dynamic typing should consider the project's needs, complexity, and the trade-offs between early error detection and development flexibility. Some languages, like Python, offer type hints or annotations to introduce a degree of static type checking while retaining the advantages of dynamic typing. There are even more strategies within interpreted languages that you can use to achieve a sense of type safety. Though the speed takeway may make this the wrong choice for certain projects.
