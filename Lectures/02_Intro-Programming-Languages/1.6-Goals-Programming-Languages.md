# Goals of Programming Languages

The goals of programming languages differ from language to language. C on one hand was built to run on small computers and be very efficient in doing so, but was expanded drastically from its original goals. Languages like Python had a goal of being readable and have a quick learning curve. The original goals of languages though can be transformed as they evolve and new use cases are realized. 

Now that we know what some of the goals may entail, here are some common goals of programming languages:

1. **Readability and Maintainability**: One of the primary goals of programming languages is to make code readable and understandable. A human-readable code is easier to maintain and debug. Languages with clear syntax and structure contribute to this goal.

2. **Efficiency**: Many programming languages aim to enable developers to write efficient and optimized code. This can include low-level languages for system programming, which provide fine-grained control over hardware resources, as well as high-level languages that focus on optimizing for specific use cases.

3. **Portability**: Portability means that code written in one language can run on multiple platforms without modification. Languages like Java and Python aim for high portability by using virtual machines or interpreters that abstract away the underlying hardware.

4. **Scalability**: Languages designed for large and complex systems should support scalability. They should allow for the development of both small scripts and large applications with a consistent and manageable codebase.

5. **Abstraction**: Programming languages often provide varying levels of abstraction, allowing developers to work at the level of detail appropriate to their task. High-level languages abstract low-level details, making development more accessible and faster.

6. **Expressiveness**: A key goal is to make code expressive, allowing developers to convey their intentions clearly and concisely. Expressive languages help in reducing code verbosity and promoting better understanding.

7. **Safety and Security**: Some languages prioritize safety and security, aiming to prevent common programming errors and vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows and memory leaks. Rust, for example, focuses on memory safety.

8. **Community and Ecosystem**: A strong community and ecosystem are essential for a programming language's success. This includes a wide range of libraries, frameworks, and tools, as well as a supportive developer community. A good example of this is the Python community, with collaboration the original design goals of Python have been broadened drastically. 

9. **Interoperability**: Some languages are designed to work well with other languages. For example, scripting languages like Python and Ruby can be embedded in C/C++ applications, and languages like C# provide interop capabilities for integrating with other .NET languages.

10. **Conciseness**: Concise code reduces the chance of errors and makes code easier to understand. Languages like Python and Ruby prioritize code conciseness while maintaining readability.

11. **Performance**: Performance-oriented languages, often used in systems programming and scientific computing, aim to provide maximum control over hardware resources and execution speed.

12. **Paradigm Support**: Many languages are designed to support specific programming paradigms, such as object-oriented programming, functional programming, or concurrent programming. The language's features and tools are tailored to these paradigms.

13. **Standardization**: Standardization helps ensure consistency across implementations and platforms. Language standards are essential for cross-compatibility and preventing fragmentation.

14. **Ease of Learning**: Some languages are designed to be easy for beginners to learn and use. They often have simple and clear syntax and a gentle learning curve.

15. **Specialization**: Certain languages are created for specific domains or use cases. For example, SQL is designed for database querying, and MATLAB is specialized for numerical computing.


# What about Golang???

Now that we know about some of the key goals of programming languages, what are the design goals behind Golang?

1. **Simplicity and Clarity**: Go is designed to be simple and easy to understand. It has a clean and minimalistic syntax that reduces the cognitive load on developers. The language aims to be straightforward and readable.

2. **Efficiency**: Go is designed for efficient compilation and execution. It compiles to machine code quickly, and its garbage collector is designed to minimize latency. The language is intended to be fast both in terms of development and runtime performance.

3. **Concurrent and Parallel Programming**: Go promotes concurrent and parallel programming through goroutines (lightweight threads) and channels. It provides built-in support for concurrent execution, making it easier to write scalable and efficient concurrent software.

4. **Safety**: Go emphasizes safety and security. It includes features like memory safety and garbage collection, reducing the likelihood of common programming errors, such as buffer overflows and memory leaks.

5. **Robust Standard Library**: Go comes with a rich standard library that includes support for network and web programming, file I/O, data structures, and more. This makes it well-suited for a wide range of applications without the need for third-party libraries.

6. **Strong Typing and Static Compilation**: Go has a strong and static type system, which helps catch errors at compile time, providing greater predictability and reliability in code.

7. **Built-in Concurrency Primitives**: Go provides a built-in model for concurrency with goroutines and channels, making it easier to write concurrent and parallel programs without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

8. **Tooling**: Go places a strong emphasis on developer tooling. It comes with a robust toolchain, including a package manager (`go get`), code formatter (`gofmt`), and a built-in testing framework.

9. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Go is designed to be cross-platform, allowing developers to write code on one platform and compile it for other platforms without modification. This helps with portability.

10. **Garbage Collection**: Go uses a garbage collector that automatically manages memory, reducing the burden on developers for memory management tasks.

11. **Orthogonality**: Go encourages code that is orthogonal, meaning that it separates concerns and avoids interdependencies. This leads to cleaner, more maintainable code.

12. **Open Source and Community-Driven**: Go is an open-source language with an active and supportive community. It encourages contributions and has a transparent development process.

These design goals reflect Go's focus on simplicity, efficiency, and developer productivity while addressing the challenges of modern software development, including concurrent programming and network services. Go has found popularity in areas like web development, cloud services, microservices, and containerization due to its design principles.
