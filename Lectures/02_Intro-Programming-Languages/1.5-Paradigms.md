# **Programming Paradigms**

Here's a list of programming paradigms paired with a language that epitomizes each, along with a brief explanation for each choice:

1. **Imperative Programming**: **C**
   - C is the quintessential example of imperative programming, where the focus is on how to execute, with statements changing a program's state. It emphasizes a step-by-step approach to instruction sequences.

2. **Declarative Programming**: **SQL**
   - SQL (Structured Query Language) is a prime example of declarative programming. It allows users to specify what data to retrieve or manipulate without detailing the exact procedures for doing so.

3. **Procedural Programming**: **Pascal**
   - Pascal is often associated with procedural programming. It structures code with procedures (also known as routines or functions) and leads to a top-down approach in program design.

4. **Functional Programming**: **Haskell**
   - Haskell is a standard-bearer for functional programming. It treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

5. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: **Java**
   - Java is synonymous with object-oriented programming. It uses classes and objects to encapsulate data and methods, promoting concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

6. **Logical Programming**: **Prolog**
   - Prolog stands out in logical programming. It is based on formal logic, and its programs consist of sets of logical relationships (facts and rules) that describe problems to be solved.

7. **Event-Driven Programming**: **JavaScript**
   - JavaScript, especially in the context of web development, is a key language for event-driven programming. It's designed to respond to user interactions (events), making it ideal for developing interactive web pages.

8. **Concurrent and Parallel Programming**: **Erlang**
   - Erlang is designed for concurrent and parallel programming. It’s used in telecoms and other high-availability applications due to its lightweight process model and built-in support for concurrency, distribution, and fault tolerance.

Each of these languages offers a distinct paradigm that can be particularly useful in demonstrating specific concepts in your computer science courses.


## Deeper Dive


Programming paradigms are fundamental approaches to structuring and solving problems in computer programming. Each paradigm offers a set of principles and practices that guide how code is written and organized. Understanding these paradigms is crucial for software developers, as they influence the design, readability, maintainability, and efficiency of code. Here is an overview of some common programming paradigms:


**Imperative Programming:**
   - Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that describes computation in terms of statements that change a program state. 
   - In simple terms, it's like giving step-by-step instructions to the computer. It focuses on describing how a program operates, specifying the sequence of commands for the computer to perform. 
   - Most languages we're familiar with, including **Python, C++, and Java**, are primarily imperative.

   - An example in Python (imperative style) might look like this:
   ```python
   result = []
   for i in range(10):
      result.append(i * 2)
   ```
   > <sub>Notice the step by step approach to create the list (as compared to the example below in declarative).</sub>

   

**Declarative Programming:**
   - Declarative programming, on the other hand, is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. 
   - It focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how to achieve that result. 
   - SQL and HTML are classic examples of declarative programming, and functional languages like Haskell emphasize declarative concepts.

   - An example in Python (declarative style) might look like this:
   ```python
   result = [i * 2 for i in range(10)]
   ```

   > <sub>This declarative example uses a list comprehension, which is more about describing the desired list rather than detailing how to build it step by step.</sub>

   - **To summarize Imperative vs Declarative:**
     - Imperative programming is like a recipe that tells you the steps to make a dish.
     - Declarative programming is like a picture of the dish that lets you figure out the steps yourself.

**Procedural Programming:**

   - Procedural programming is a subtype of imperative programming. 
   - It takes the concept of imperative programming further by organizing code into procedures or functions. 
   - These procedures can be called upon to perform specific tasks, and they allow for code reuse, better organization, and more structured programming. 
   - In procedural programming, the state of the program is still important, and procedures are often used to modify that state.
   - Examples of procedural programming languages include C, BASIC, and Fortran.

**Functional Programming:**
   - Functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. It emphasizes immutability, first-class functions, and higher-order functions to write clean and declarative code.
   - Example languages: Haskell, Lisp,

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
   - OOP is centered around the concept of objects and classes. Objects encapsulate data and behavior, and inheritance and polymorphism allow for modeling real-world entities and interactions.
   - Example languages: Java, C++, Python.

**Logical Programming:**
   - Logical programming is based on formal logic and rules. Programs consist of statements that describe the problem's logic, and the system finds solutions based on the provided rules.
   - Example languages: Prolog, Mercury.

**Event-Driven Programming:**
   - Event-driven programming responds to events or user actions. It's commonly used in GUI applications, where events trigger actions or functions.
   - Example languages: JavaScript, Visual Basic.

**Concurrent and Parallel Programming:**
   - These paradigms address multi-threading and parallelism. Concurrent programming deals with managing multiple tasks that may run simultaneously, while parallel programming is about utilizing multiple CPU cores for improved performance.
   - Example languages: Go (for concurrent programming), MPI, OpenMP (for parallel programming).

The choice of a programming paradigm depends on the problem domain, project requirements, and developer preferences. Many modern programming languages support multiple paradigms, allowing developers to choose the one that best fits the task at hand. Understanding these paradigms equips programmers to approach problems from different angles and write more effective and maintainable code. Imagine you have a high costing computation that you are approaching suquentially and you stumble upon a parallelized version of your program that cuts the total runtime into a tenth of what it was originally. You just increased efficiency in the target system tenfold. Having the background knowledge of paradigms increases your toolset as a software engineer. Allowing you to solve more complex problems, but also increasing your earning potential.
