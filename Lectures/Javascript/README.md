### Day 1: Introduction to JavaScript and Basic DOM Manipulation
- **Duration**: ~1 hour
- **Topics**:
  - JavaScript basics (variables, data types, functions)
  - Selecting elements with vanilla JavaScript
  - Introduction to the Document Object Model (DOM)
  - Simple DOM manipulations (changing text, styles, etc.)

### Day 2: Advanced DOM Manipulation and Event Handling
- **Duration**: ~1 hour
- **Topics**:
  - Event handling (click, submit, etc.)
  - More complex DOM manipulations (creating, removing elements)
  - Introduction to a CSS framework (Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS are popular choices)
  - Practical exercise: Create a simple interactive webpage using JS and the selected CSS framework

### Day 3: Forms, Validations, and Modals
- **Duration**: ~1 hour
- **Topics**:
  - Forms and form submissions using JavaScript
  - Basic client-side validation
  - Creating and controlling modals with JavaScript
  - Exercise: Build a form with validation and a modal on submission

### Day 4: Introduction to jQuery and Simplified DOM Interaction
- **Duration**: ~1 hour
- **Topics**:
  - Introduction to jQuery (why it's still relevant)
  - Simplifying DOM manipulations with jQuery
  - Animations and effects with jQuery
  - Exercise: Refactor Day 2's exercise using jQuery

### Day 5: Asynchronous JavaScript and Fetching Data
- **Duration**: ~1-2 hours
- **Topics**:
  - Introduction to asynchronous JavaScript (callbacks, promises, async/await)
  - Fetching data using the Fetch API
  - Displaying fetched data (handling JSON)
  - Exercise: Fetch and display data in a tabular format (you could use a simple plugin like DataTables or a vanilla JS approach)

### Additional Notes:
- **CSS Framework**: Given the popularity and ease of use, I'd recommend Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS. Bootstrap is more traditional and widespread, whereas Tailwind offers more utility-first approaches which are quite trendy.
- **JavaScript Framework**: Since you're focusing on vanilla JavaScript, jQuery is a great choice for simplifying DOM manipulations without getting into the complexities of modern frameworks like React or Vue.
