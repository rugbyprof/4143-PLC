1. **[Not OOP](01-not_oop.md)**: Start with a brief introduction to Go's approach to object-oriented programming (OOP) or rather, its preference for composition over inheritance. Explain why Go doesn't have traditional classes and inheritance.

2. **[Keywords](02-new_keyword.md)**: Explain the use of the `new` keyword in Go for dynamic memory allocation, as well as why keywords exist and what others are used consistently. 

3. **[Slices of Structs](03-slices_of_structs.md)**: Discuss the use of slices of structs for managing collections of structured data.

4. **[Maps](04-maps.md)**: Introduce maps as a way to create collections of key-value pairs in Go. COmpounding on our introduction to structured data. 

5. **[Struct vs. Interface](05-struct_vs_interface.md)**: Introduce structs as the basic building blocks for data and explain interfaces as a way to define behavior. This sets the stage for understanding Go's type system and how you can mock inheritance through the use of interfaces. 

6. **[Methods vs. Functions](06-methods_vs_functions.md)**: Explore the distinction between methods and functions in Go and how methods are associated with types (structs).

7. **[Functions](07-functions.md)**: Discuss the concept of first-class functions in Go and how functions can be treated as values, covering anonymous functions and user-defined function types. Higher order types that allow returning functions, and accepting functions as parameters. This is very similar to Javascript's callback functions. A gener

8. **[Interfaces](08-interfaces.md)**: Go deeper into interfaces, covering interface declaration, implementation, and polymorphism

9. **[Composition and Packages](09-composition_and_packages.md)**: Jump into more advanced concepts within composition and packages in golang. Introductory level packages. 

10. **[Packages](10-packages_in_depth.md)**: Showcase the power of packages in Golang and the ease of code reuse in projects. Code examples showcase useful package structures as well as basic syntax needed to work with multiple types of packages. 
   
11. **[Composition Over Inheritance](11-comp_over_inherit.md)**: Reinforce the idea of composition over inheritance, showing how to embed structs within other structs and use composition to build complex types.
   
12. **[Encapsulation](12-encapsulation.md)** Further clarify implementation hiding within Go and how the language implements public/private for its data structures and packages.
