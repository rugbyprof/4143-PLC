## Go Basics

Here are some examples that demonstrate variables, data types, and basic operations in the Go programming language:

**1. Declaring and Initializing Variables:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var a int
    a = 10

    var b = 20

    c := 30

    fmt.Println("a:", a)
    fmt.Println("b:", b)
    fmt.Println("c:", c)
}
```

**2. Basic Data Types and Type Inference:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Integer types
    var num int = 42
    var age = 30

    // Floating-point types
    var pi float32 = 3.14
    var height = 5.8

    // String type
    var message string = "Hello, Go!"

    // Boolean type
    var isTrue bool = true

    fmt.Println("num:", num)
    fmt.Println("age:", age)
    fmt.Println("pi:", pi)
    fmt.Println("height:", height)
    fmt.Println("message:", message)
    fmt.Println("isTrue:", isTrue)
}
```

**3. Basic Arithmetic Operations:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    a := 10
    b := 3

    // Addition
    sum := a + b
    fmt.Println("Sum:", sum)

    // Subtraction
    diff := a - b
    fmt.Println("Difference:", diff)

    // Multiplication
    product := a * b
    fmt.Println("Product:", product)

    // Division
    quotient := a / b
    fmt.Println("Quotient:", quotient)

    // Modulus
    remainder := a % b
    fmt.Println("Remainder:", remainder)
}
```

**4. String Concatenation:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    firstName := "John"
    lastName := "Doe"

    fullName := firstName + " " + lastName
    fmt.Println("Full Name:", fullName)
}
```

**5. Boolean Operations:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    a := true
    b := false

    // Logical AND
    resultAnd := a && b
    fmt.Println("Logical AND:", resultAnd)

    // Logical OR
    resultOr := a || b
    fmt.Println("Logical OR:", resultOr)

    // Logical NOT
    resultNot := !a
    fmt.Println("Logical NOT:", resultNot)
}
```

These examples showcase how to work with variables, different data types, and perform basic operations in the Go programming language.

## Declaring Variables

In Go (Golang), there are different ways to declare and initialize variables, each with its own use cases and implications. Let's go through each method:

1. **var keyword:**
   The `var` keyword is used for declaring variables with explicit type information. This method is often used at the package level or when you need to declare variables without immediately initializing them.

   ```go
   var age int
   var name string
   ```

   In this case, the variables `age` and `name` are declared but not immediately initialized. They are assigned their respective zero values (`0` for `int` and `""` for `string`).

2. **Short variable declaration (:=):**
   The `:=` operator is used for short variable declarations. It both declares and initializes variables, inferring their types from the assigned values. This method is commonly used within functions or for local variables.

   ```go
   func main() {
       age := 25
       name := "Alice"
   }
   ```

   The `:=` syntax is more concise and convenient for local variables, but it can only be used inside functions or code blocks.

3. **Assignment without declaration:**
   In Go, you can also assign values to variables without explicitly declaring their types using the `=` operator. This is used when you want to change the value of an existing variable or when the type is already known.

   ```go
   age = 30
   name = "Bob"
   ```

   This method assumes that the variables `age` and `name` have been previously declared. If they haven't been declared, you'll encounter a compilation error.

Each of these methods serves different purposes:

- **`var` keyword:** It's used when you want to explicitly declare variables at the package level or when you need zero values for variables.

- **Short variable declaration (`:=`):** It's used for concise initialization of local variables inside functions or code blocks. The type is inferred from the assigned value.

- **Assignment without declaration (`=`):** This is used to assign new values to variables that have been previously declared. It's not suitable for declaring new variables.

In general, the short variable declaration `:=` is commonly used within functions, as it helps to write more concise code, while the `var` keyword is often used at the package level and when explicit type declaration is necessary. The assignment operator `=` is used for reassigning values to already declared variables.
