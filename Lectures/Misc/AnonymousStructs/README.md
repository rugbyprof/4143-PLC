## Anonymous Struct

An anonymous embedded struct in Go is a struct that is embedded within another struct without specifying a field name for it. 

Here's a short use case to explain the significance of an anonymous embedded struct:

- Suppose you are designing a system for handling different types of vehicles, such as cars, motorcycles, and bicycles. Each vehicle type has common attributes like "make," "model," and "year," but they also have specific attributes unique to each type.

- Using an anonymous embedded struct, you can create a common base struct that holds the shared attributes, and then embed this base struct anonymously within each specific vehicle type struct. Here's an example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Base struct for common vehicle attributes
type Vehicle struct {
    Make  string
    Model string
    Year  int
}

// Specific struct for cars
type Car struct {
    Vehicle // Anonymous embedded struct
    Doors   int
}

// Specific struct for motorcycles
type Motorcycle struct {
    Vehicle // Anonymous embedded struct
    EngineSize int
}

func main() {
    // Create instances of specific vehicle types
    car := Car{
        Vehicle: Vehicle{
            Make:  "Toyota",
            Model: "Camry",
            Year:  2022,
        },
        Doors: 4,
    }

    motorcycle := Motorcycle{
        Vehicle: Vehicle{
            Make:  "Honda",
            Model: "CBR500R",
            Year:  2021,
        },
        EngineSize: 500,
    }

    // Access common attributes using anonymous embedded struct
    fmt.Printf("Car: Make=%s, Model=%s, Year=%d, Doors=%d\n",
        car.Make, car.Model, car.Year, car.Doors)

    fmt.Printf("Motorcycle: Make=%s, Model=%s, Year=%d, EngineSize=%dcc\n",
        motorcycle.Make, motorcycle.Model, motorcycle.Year, motorcycle.EngineSize)
}
```

In this example:

1. The `Vehicle` struct holds common attributes for all types of vehicles: "Make," "Model," and "Year."

2. The `Car` and `Motorcycle` structs embed the `Vehicle` struct anonymously. This means that the fields of the `Vehicle` struct become directly accessible from instances of `Car` and `Motorcycle` without the need for field names.

3. By using anonymous embedded structs, you can reuse and share common attributes while maintaining a clear and concise struct hierarchy. This approach helps reduce redundancy and makes it easier to manage and extend your codebase when working with various types of objects that share common characteristics.
